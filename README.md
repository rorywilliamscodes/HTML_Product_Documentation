HTML:
The HTML code represents the structure and content of the webpage. It uses semantic elements to define different sections and components of the page, such as the navigation bar, main content area, headers, paragraphs, and code snippets. The HTML code also includes appropriate attributes to provide additional information and functionality, such as linking sections through anchor tags and assigning unique identifiers to elements.

CSS:
The CSS code is responsible for the visual styling and presentation of the webpage. It applies various styles, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, to enhance the overall appearance and readability of the content. The CSS code uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and applies rules and properties to define their visual attributes. It ensures consistency, responsiveness, and an aesthetically pleasing design across different devices and screen sizes through the use of media queries and responsive techniques. The CSS code also incorporates best practices for maintainability and organization, utilizing classes and IDs to target specific elements and applying reusable styles through cascading and inheritance.
